Renamed column headers for clarity and consistency.
Converted the Date column to datetime format.
Checked for and removed missing data to ensure accuracy.
2. General Analysis & Visualizations
Line Plot: Trend of unemployment rate over time across India.
Bar Plot: Average unemployment rate for each state.
Heatmap: Month-wise unemployment rate across states.
3. Interactive User Analysis
Implemented a function for users to input a state name.
Generates a line plot showing unemployment rate over time for the selected state.
Outputs the average and maximum unemployment rate for that state with date info.
